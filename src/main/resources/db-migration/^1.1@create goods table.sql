'Author: Gabriel García Márquez.\nThe brilliant, bestselling, landmark novel that tells the story of the Buendia family, and chronicles the irreconcilable conflict between the desire for solitude and the need for love—in rich, imaginative prose that has come to define an entire genre known as "magical realism."',
'"You emerge from this marvelous novel as if from a dream, the mind on fire . . . With a single bound, Gabriel García Márquez leaps onto the stage with Günter Grass and Vladimir Nabokov, his appetite as enormous as his imagination, his fatalism greater than either. Dazzling."—THE NEW YORK TIMES\n"García Márquez forces upon us at every page the wonder and extravagance of life, while compassionately mocking its effusions; and when the book ends . . . we are left with that pleasant exhaustion which only very great novels provide . . . [García Márquez] makes us feel as if we had survived his century of articulate dreams only to awaken and discover that they must finally all come true."—THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS\n"In a beautiful translation, surrealism and innocence blend to form a wholly individual style. Like rum calentano, the story goes down easily, leaving a rich, sweet burning flavor behind."—TIME"Rabassa''s translation is a triumph of fluent, gravid momentum, all stylishness and commonsensical virtuosity . . . García Márquez feeds the mind''s eye non-stop . . . Like the jungle itself, this novel comes back again and again, fecund, savage and irresistible.”—CHICAGO TRIBUNE BOOK WORLD');

'When Mario Puzo''s blockbuster saga, The Godfather, was first published in 1969, critics hailed it as one of the greatest novels of our time, and "big, turbulent, highly entertaining." Since then, The Godfather has gone on to become a part of America''s national culture, as well as a trilogy of landmark motion pictures. From the lavish opening scene where Don Corleone entertains guests and conducts business at his daughter''s wedding...to his son, Michael, who takes his father''s place to fight for his family...to the bloody climax where all family business is finished, The Godfather is an epic story of family, loyalty, and how "men of honor" live in their own world, and die by their own laws.',
'The story of Don Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia family, inspired some of the most successful movies ever. It is in Mario Puzo''s The Godfather that Corleone first appears. As Corleone''s desperate struggle to control the Mafia underworld unfolds, so does the story of his family. The novel is full of exquisitely detailed characters who, despite leading unconventional lifestyles within a notorious crime family, experience the triumphs and failures of the human condition. Filled with the requisite valor, love, and rancor of a great epic, The Godfather is the definitive gangster novel.\nDiehard Godfather fans play second banana to no other subculture in their obsession with the minutiae of Puzo''s novel and Coppola''s films. These dedicated fans will be most disappointed by the new audio version, although perhaps only an hour of material is missing, but casual aficionados will barely notice the abridgment. Missing are the subplot involving Sonny''s mistress, Lucy Mancini, and Dr. William Kennedy and the descriptions of the regional Mafia chieftains that precede the commission meeting at which Don Corleone flushes out Don Barzini as his number one rival. Actor Joe Mantegna does a fine job throughout, largely resisting the temptation to put on voices for too many of the characters. However, this cannot be said for his Don Corleone. Perhaps it is vengeance: after all, Andy Garcia, as the late Don''s nephew, Vincent Mancini, put the hit on Mantegna''s Joey Zasa in Godfather III, but whatever the reason, Mantegna gives Corleone a raspy falsetto-imagine the Pillsbury Doughboy with a tracheotomy-that ranks as one of the worst Brando impressions ever. Also, Puzo''s chilling ending in which Kay converts to Catholicism with the hope of saving her husband''s soul is inexplicably transformed into a chamber-of-commerce-style bromide about the family''s new life in Nevada. Still, the popularity of Puzo''s novel 27 years after its publication makes this abridgment a must-have.----Adam Mazmanian, "Library Journal"\n"You can''t stop reading it." - New York magazine\n"A staggering triumph." - The Saturday Review\n"Utter believability." - Los Angeles Times\nMario Puzo was born on Manhattan''s West Side in the neighborhood known as Hell''s Kitchen. His first books, The Fortunate Pilgrim ("a minor classic" New York Times) and Dark Arena, brought him critical acclaim, but it was the publication of The Godfather in March 1969 that catapulted him into the front ranks of American authors. Reviewers hailed the book as "a staggering triumph" (Saturday Review), "big, turbulent, highly entertaining" (Newsweek), "remarkable" (Look), and "a voyeur''s dream, a skillful fantasy of violent personal power" (New York Times). Winning readers by the millions, it stayed at or near the top of the New York Times bestseller lists for sixty-nine weeks. His follow-up novel, Fools Die (1978), was hailed as the publishing event of the decade. Puzo''s last novel, Omerta, was finished shortly before his death in 1999.\nThe Godfather is, in many ways, not just a novel - it is an experience, after which your life will never be the same again. I have not the least of doubts in calling it ''the best, most influential and deep-cutting that I have ever read.'' In its sheer departure from being just a general, run-of-the-mill tale about idolizing a particular individual, the novel presents to us with a ringside view of the workings of the Mafia, and more importantly, the lives of the people who are involved in it, directly or indirectly.\nThe novel starts off with a quote from Balzac - "Behind every great fortune, there is a crime." That, in effect, sets the tone for the entire novel. Mario Puzo, the author, ruthlessly captures the travails of a New York Don, Vito Corleone, who is, to quote the words of his son, "not a crazy gunning mobster", and his family.\nPuzo presents to us an entire array of different characters - be it the short-tempered Sonny, or the dreary undertaker Bonasera, or the ever-faithful Luca, the cool-headed Tom, the ''Turk'' Sollozzo, or the pleasant outsider Kay Adams, each character enters our world, refusing to leave. We are impressed by most of these essentially evil people because the story is told in an entirely closed world (of crime) and so we tend to love characters whom we would, in the normal course, detest.\nThe novel is, basically, about just two persons, Don Vito Corleone and his son, Michael, who after refusing to accept his father''s ways, finally comes to terms with the reality and takes up the ''family business''.\nPuzo shows us why he is the great author he really is! The character of the Don pervades our thoughts more than most (or almost all) other fictional characters do. Though the nature of his business is violent, the Don is portrayed as a genial, kind and reasonable man. To say the least, the Don is someone whom `every son will look for in his father, every woman will look for in her husband, and any mortal will look for in an inspirational leader.'' In fact, the Godfather is what every man aspires to be - a strong, powerful and wise yet cunning genius and family man.\nI have not read a better novel - chances are, you won''t either! Do not miss the Godfather movies too.----By Vijay Krishna on September 1, 2002');
